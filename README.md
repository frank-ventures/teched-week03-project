# Week Three Project

## Project- Building an accessible image gallery

This week we were tasked to combine what we'd learned about accessibility, @media queries, responsiveness, APIs and user interaction, on top of our existing HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.

There were three main sections to the project this week:

- I want to browse a set of thumbnail images that load quickly
- I want to select a thumbnail and display a larger version of the image, with a description
- I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images, and the ability to click next and previous buttons using the keyboard

I kept track of my thoughts and tasks here: [https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Nine-9c5ea40fad3e4b31aaacca0253e92175](https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Twelve-project-167b05580f704e5abffee38bacbd55cb?pvs=4)
